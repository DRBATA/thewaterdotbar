# The Water Bar – Strategic Suggestions & Next Steps

This file summarizes actionable opportunities and enhancements discussed across analytics, Resend, Supabase, and community-building. Use this as a roadmap to guide your next moves (and to free your mind for creative UI work!).

---

## 1. Analytics & Funnel Tracking
- **Continue leveraging your analytics_events table** for full-funnel tracking (landing → cart → checkout → order).
- **Capture and persist UTM parameters** (utm_campaign, utm_source, etc.) for every session; ensure these are passed to Stripe metadata and Resend emails for end-to-end attribution.
- **Link Stripe payments to sessions/campaigns** by always passing session_id and UTM fields as metadata when creating Stripe Checkout Sessions.
- **Enable dashboard drill-down:**
  - Add clickable campaign/source breakdowns (e.g., click a campaign to see all sessions/orders).
  - Add session-level journey views (see all actions for a given session/user).
  - Filter by date, campaign, or product for granular analysis.

## 2. Resend (Email Automation & Community)
- **Integrate Resend for transactional and community emails:**
  - Send ticket/receipt emails with event info, PIN, and upgrade offers.
  - Send pre-event reminders and post-event thank-yous/feedback requests.
  - Use UTM data for segmentation and personalized offers.
- **Build a guest/community list:**
  - Import all past event guests into your main DB.
  - Track engagement and opt-ins for future events and offers.
- **Admin tools:**
  - Create an admin dashboard to view, filter, and email guests by event, engagement, or campaign.
  - Generate and send unique tracking links (UTDs) for future engagement.

## 3. Supabase (Data & Operations)
- **Maintain normalized structure:**
  - Continue using cart_headers, cart_items, orders, and order_items for clean, scalable data.
- **Join analytics with operational data:**
  - Use session_id and UTM fields to connect analytics_events, cart, and orders for full-funnel reporting.
- **Optimize for event ops:**
  - Use PIN-based check-in as primary, with guest lookup as fallback.
  - Export guest lists or check-in data as needed for on-the-day ops.

---

## 4. Community & Growth
- **Welcome/Onboarding flows:**
  - Automated welcome emails for new guests.
  - Community opt-in forms for ongoing engagement.
- **VIP/loyalty programs:**
  - Use analytics to identify and reward top guests.
- **Feedback & storytelling:**
  - Post-event surveys, collect stories/photos, and share in community emails.

---

## 5. Technical & UX Housekeeping
- **Ensure cart/checkout UI is always visible and accessible (even with chat open).**
- **Continue refining mobile/responsive experience.**
- **Regularly review analytics for drop-offs and conversion opportunities.**

---

## 6. Optional Integrations
- **Drip:** Only needed if you want advanced email automation beyond Resend. If so, pass Drip client ID as metadata for cross-system analytics.
- **Bit.ly:** Avoid if it introduces friction (ads); use direct links for best guest experience.

---

## 7. Next Steps Checklist
- [ ] Review and document current UTM/analytics capture logic.
- [ ] Add UTM/session_id to Stripe and Resend flows.
- [ ] Build or enhance admin dashboard for guest/community management.
- [ ] Design and automate first community email via Resend.
- [ ] Add drill-down to dashboard for campaign/session/product analytics.
